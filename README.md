- NOTE: `librewolf/prefs.js` MUST end in a newline for `read` to work
  - [userChrome.css stolen from aagaming](https://git.catvibers.me/aa/nix/src/commit/42c4ee8d52538ee5f53045a90f528072e12c097c/desktop/apps/web/userChrome.css) (and modified a bit)

## TODO

- I'm currently away and only have an ARM Windows laptop, plus given niri's borked in Hyper-V for me, and somewhat borked in WSL, I can't test much - it should be tested and fixed 2025-06-21.
- do [this](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Configuration:-Named-Workspaces) for left and right monitors
- fix Mod+Shift+{H,L}

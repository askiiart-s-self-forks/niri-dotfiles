- NOTE: `librewolf/prefs.js` MUST end in a newline for `read` to work
  - [userChrome.css stolen from aagaming](https://git.catvibers.me/aa/nix/src/commit/42c4ee8d52538ee5f53045a90f528072e12c097c/desktop/apps/web/userChrome.css) (and modified a bit)

## Note

It's unlikely I'll switch to niri, as I'm quite a fan of not being limited to however-many-workspaces-are-in-use-plus-one, and don't really care for the tiling, it just doesn't fit me quite as well. But I do very much like some aspects of it, so I might come back and configure it even more or something.

Also, X11 via xwayland-satellite doesn't seem to be working? And I have no idea why.

Update: I've been told to add Sylveon. So I am adding Sylveon.
